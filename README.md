# Buffer Overflow Drive Effect

This is a re-creation of the DOD Overdrive 250 / MXR Distortion+ op-amp drive circuit, as a first attempt at basic PCB design in [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/).

## Credit
The basic schematic I worked from is available from a variety of sources, but this was primarily derived from the [PedalPCB Distortion 250](https://www.pedalpcb.com/product/dist250/). I strongly endorse PedalPCB (and this pedal) as a great way to get started building effects.


## The name
*The name "Buffer Overflow" is a reflection of the nature of the effect (an overdrive) and security nerdery.*
